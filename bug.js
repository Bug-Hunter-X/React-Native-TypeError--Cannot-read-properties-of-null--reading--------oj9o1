This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  For example:

```javascript
const myObject = null;
console.log(myObject.someProperty); // TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'someProperty')
```

This is common when dealing with asynchronous operations where data might not be available immediately.  If `myObject` is fetched from an API, it could be `null` before the fetch completes.
